                            <h3>Become a Science Maniac</h3>
                            <p>  Are you struggling with your Math/Physics classes, craving success but always find yourself miss a target on your goals? the good news is that you're not alone. so many students find it hard to excel in math classes no matter how hard they try. I have a real experience on that situation. with that said, I can help you get around your past failures and jump straight to success in these subjects. I am James, I have a strong knowledge in mathematics and physics as well as a real life experience in teaching. what if I tell you that I want to share my skills and pro tips on how to beat math really bad like a maniac, would you be interested in taking a look? if you study Cambridge international As and A level mathematics 9709 or Physics 9702 then you are at the right place.  I am preparing a well explained and comprehensive course of math/physics covering well the concepts of Year 12 and year 13 at really low price (30,000Frw). when the courses are ready they will be accessible on Udemy.com, a world's leading online learning platform such that everyone who wills to learn might find it out there, anytime, anywhere and on any device. the course is purely based on the updated syllabuses from Cambridge and it is well documented with notes and tones of exercises.  you may ask yourself the existing difference between having this course and attending real classes or watching YouTube tutorials. Speaking from experience, you definitely need a tutor who teaches you exactly what you will be asked in exams, the thing that I can do but not a YouTuber. in my journey to success in academic subjects, I once used YouTube videos also to get clarification on what I couldn't catch from the teacher. guess what? I could hardly find the exact explanation of what I was questing as  the instructors outta there are teaching general stuff not basing on particular curriculum like Cambridge, Edexel or national program. I have great knowledge in math of Cambridge and national program as I took both AS and A level Cambridge international examinations and Rwanda's advanced level exams in math, physics and computer Science. below is a sample video lecture of how I get my students know everything that I teach them. </p>
